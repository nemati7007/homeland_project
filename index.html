                    Kyiv (or Kiev), Ukraine's capital, is a large city located
                    on the shores of the Dnipro river. Of course, no one in
                    their right mind would swim in the river, unless they grew
                    up here, in which case they've probably tried it at some
                    point. Summers are hot here, and the winters are drafty, but
                    the fall and the spring are are absolutely amazing.

                  <p class="card__text">
                    The city itself is a mix of pre-revolution, post-war and
                    soviet architecture, all of it sprinkled with modified
                    balconies. If you're on the right bank of the Dnipro, the
                    landscape is difficult to traverse for people on bikes and
                    those wearing heels. The left bank is considered far less
                    interesting and prestigious though, even by people who live
                    on the far outskirts of the right one.

                    The medieval ruin of Cricieth Castle overlooks the town
                    below from a rock that juts out into the sea. It is thought
                    to have been built by Llewelyn the Great in the 13th
                    century. Some 900 years later, the self-styled Pearl of
                    Wales on the Shores of Snowdonia has become a popular
                    tourist destination during the summer months.

                    ingredient is rumored to be locally sourced seaweed. Another
                    claim to fame is the fact that Cricieth won the Wales in
                    Bloom award for five years in a row for its spectacular
                    floral displays around town. It was also home to David Lloyd

                    Berea is a small town located in the central part of
                    Kentucky. The town is surrounded by beautiful forests and
                    countryside. It's known as the arts and crafts capital of
                    the state, and visitors will find plenty of shopping
                    opportunities: shops with handmade jewelry, candles, wood
                    items, galleries, glass studios, and more. The town holds a
                    yearly festival celebrating "spoonbread", a local dish made
                    with cornbread and served with a wooden spoon.

                    However, it's probably known best for the local college.
                    Berea College was founded in 1855 and was the first college
                    in the south to be racially integrated, as well as the first
                    to be coeducational. Somewhat uniquely, it charges no
                    tuition — every student receives a full-tuition scholarship.
